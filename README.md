## About the Project
In this project, I built a fun Tic Tac Toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This game lets two players compete, taking turns to place their 'X' or 'O' on a 3x3 grid. The first player to align three marks in a row, column, or diagonal wins the game! I added features like reset and restart buttons, hover effects to indicate the current player, and a winning message that pops up when the game ends.
